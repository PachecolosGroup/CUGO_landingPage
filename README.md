# CUGO_landingPage
Proyect for Project Management - University 

In a project made for Project Management, we created a whole new visual representation for the brand, logo, branding, how he speaks, and behaves in the social media world, and the entire landing page structure to get every single step of the process made to catch the eye of people, and maybe get some views on the project, that is to create new ways of leather using the nature.
